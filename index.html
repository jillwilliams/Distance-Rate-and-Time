        Distance, Rate, and Time
    </h1>
    <p>
        When dealing with traveling, there is a distinct relationship between the distance traveled, how fast you drive, and the time spent driving, in hours.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
        Distance = Rate x Time
    </p>

        Before we look at the formula, let's cover a pre-skills topic that will help you remember the steps to get the answer.
    </p>
    <p>
        The triangles shown below are called "Math-Fact Triangles".

    <hr>
    <p>
        The number at the top of the triangle is always equal to the result of multiplying the two numbers at the bottom left and right corners.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
        The number at the top of the triangle divided by the number in the bottom left corner, equals the number in the bottom right corner.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
        The number at the top of the triangle divided by the number in the bottom right corner, equals the number in the bottom left corner.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
        For Math Fact Triangles these relationships are always true.
    </p>
    The relationship between distance, rate, and time can be modeled using a math fact triangle.
    </p>

    <p>
        The Math Fact Triangle has three relationships:<br>
        Rate x Time = Distance<br>
        Distance ÷ Rate = Time<br>
        Distance ÷ Time = Rate<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        When working out a distance, rate, and time problem, use the diagram to set up your problem so you can get the correct answer.

        Example 1:<br>
        Stan drives 60 mph for 2 hours. How far did Stan drive?
        <img src="images/img2.png" alt="ex1" id="img1" />
        The 2 bottom numbers always multiply to equal the top number.<br>We need Distance. 60 x 2 = 120 miles  
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
        Example 2:<br>
        Betty drove 160 miles in 2 1/2 hours. How fast was she driving?
        <img src="images/img3.png" alt="ex2" id="img2" />
        The top number divided by the bottom right corner equals the missing value in the bottom left corner.<br>
        160 ÷ 2.5 = 64. Betty was driving 64mph.
    </p>

        Example 3:<br>
        Jeff drove 70 miles per hour for a total distance of 465 miles. How long did Jeff drive.
        <img src="images/img4.png" alt="ex3" id="img3" />
        The top number divided by the bottom left corner equals the missing value in the bottom right corner.<br>
        465 ÷ 70 = 6.6. Jeff drove for 6.6 hours.
